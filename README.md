drawing with SVG turtle doesn't show you the animation! I use VS Code Live Server to view the SVG in the browser.

# learned
Without any real effort I was able to get Git Hub Co Pilot to generate some basic functions for me.

What I quickly realized that since each letter is it's own function, I would need to think about running each one separately!

I SHOULD have made a grid to draw out the location of each coordinate. Maybe even graphed a background in Turtle first... later. It's time for dinner.
