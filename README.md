# question
How can I call a complete SVG object through a python function?
e.g.
```def call_the_blob_svg()
    with open ('blob.svg') as f:
        return f
```

# research and dev
This is exciting!

and this is too!

I wonder if I can get these tools running on github codespace!

# note
Drawing with SVG turtle doesn't show you the animation! I use VS Code Live Server to view the SVG in the browser.

# learned
Without any real effort I was able to get Git Hub Co Pilot to generate some basic functions for me.

What I quickly realized that since each letter is it's own function, I would need to think about running each one separately!

I SHOULD have made a grid to draw out the location of each coordinate. Maybe even graphed a background in Turtle first... later. It's time for dinner.

# todo1
Pass functions to functions

e.g. I have a spiral function.

Pass the triangle function to the spiral function.


# todo2
Figure out the fill option

# todo3

# challenge1
Draw shapes randomly on screen but don't let them touch.

# challenge2
Add argv to activate varables from command line

# challenge3
Stack geometry on center of highest point of geometry

# challenge 4
Make function that fills the screen with any of the shapes
